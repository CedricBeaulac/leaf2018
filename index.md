# Materials

## Instructor Tutorials
Tutorials for instructors wishing to integrate computation into their courses.

[Worked example from Horton (2013): probability problem with empirical and analytical solution, and discussion](http://awstringer1.github.io/leaf2018/horton2013-example3-1.html)

## Examples of Student-Facing Materials
Examples of materials that can be worked on with students as part of a course.

### Lecture Supplements
Materials that can be used during lecture as a supplement to traditional slides and blackboard writing.

(STA 261): [Normal Approximation to Binomial](http://awstringer1.github.io/leaf2018/lecture-1-normal-approx-binomial.html)

(STA 261): [Fitting a Gamma distribution to rainfall data](http://awstringer1.github.io/leaf2018/sta261-lecture2-method-of-moments-gamma.html)
### Learnr Tutorials
Hosted tutorials on course concepts writtedn using the **learnr** package in R.

(STA261): [Learnr tutorial on Law of Large Numbers and simulating random variables in R](https://awstringer1.shinyapps.io/sta261-normal-approx-binomial/)

(STA303): [Learnr tutorial involving fairly complete analysis of a textbook dataset](https://awstringer1.shinyapps.io/sta303-week1-intro-data-analysis/)

# Datasets
Below is a collection of readily available datasets that instructors can use for examples, assignments, and tests. The table includes a description of the dataset, the source, and key features/suggested uses.

| Dataset | Source | Features | Suggested Uses | Comments/Notes |
|---------|--------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Average temperature in Ann Arbor, Michigan | data(aatemp); R package **faraway** | Two variables, temperature and year, for 115 years ranging from 1854 to 2000 | Simple linear regression | Model assumptions satisfied nicely; point estimate of slope is small but statistically significant |
